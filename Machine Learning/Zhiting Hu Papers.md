Hi Gongyi,

Thanks for reaching out. We received a lot of inquiries from students for guided research, and may only be able to work with some of them with true passions and common interest. I'd be happy to know more about your background and research interest.  

Here's some of our recent work of different styles ranging from core ML to applications. Would you take a quick look and share any of your thoughts (e.g., which topics/papers you're most interested in, and what you expect to do if we collaborate, etc)?  

- NLP/ML applications: e.g., 
	- [ ] (SQL) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07704.pdf](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07704.pdf__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjY2ma4hhw$), 
	- [ ] (eval) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06379.pdf](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06379.pdf__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjYv7DFhOg$)  
- General NLP/ML algorithms: 
	- [x] (meta/RL) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12795.pdf](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12795.pdf__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjauTKDayA$), 
		- Learning Data Manipulation for Augmentation and Weighting
			New method that supports learning different manipulation schemes with the same gradient-based algorithm
	- [x] (neuro-symbolic) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09764.pdf](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09764.pdf__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjbxNEReSg$)  
		- Deep Generative Models with Learnable Knowledge Constraints 
			RL's generative model, combine with, posterior regularization -> learn better on specified constrainted feature (posture etc.)  
- [ ] Core ML: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07783](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07783__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjaA_efG0w$)  
- [ ] Causal inference: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09119](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09119__;!!Mih3wA!B5ft1A3KXQdolHTBRNghdW4fvMfzV_utewuq6RfxqGgcyeamn_-eM22cBwnfRjNgE5Y_DjYaSc_Bog$)
